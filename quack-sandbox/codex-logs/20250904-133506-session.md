# Global operating rules for Codex

**Non-negotiable logging policy**

- For every session:
  1. Determine the repo root with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`; if not a git repo, use the current directory.
  2. Create (if missing) `<repo-root>/codex-logs/>`.
  3. Write a Markdown transcript to `codex-logs/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-session.md` that includes:
     - Title line: repo name (or directory), model, profile, sandbox mode.
     - All user messages and Codex replies, verbatim (fenced Markdown blocks).
     - A **Commands** section listing every command you ran with start time, exit code, and duration.
     - A **Changes** section summarizing files you created/edited/removed and the current `git diff --no-ext-diff`.
  4. Update/append a machine-readable provenance file at `codex-logs/provenance.jsonl` with JSON lines for each command run: `{ts, cwd, cmd, exit_code, duration_ms}`.
- If no files were changed or no commands were executed, state that explicitly in the log.
- When in doubt, **prefer writing the log first** and then continuing the task so the transcript is never lost.

Please refer to this issue in pytorch: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/152668, which is referring to this grouped gemm kernel implemented here:
https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/aten/src/ATen/native/cuda/GroupMM.cu.

The underlying kernel it is calling originates from Cutlass:
./examples/57_hopper_grouped_gemm

Please examine the underlying cutlass kernel and suggest ways of fixing the M=0 hanging problem from **within** the kernel.

Create a vscode c cpp settings for this repo assumign I am developing on a Hopper gpu.  See https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/media/docs/cpp/ide_setup.html for reference.
```

```assistant
I’ll start by setting up the session log, then inspect the repo to tailor VS Code settings.
